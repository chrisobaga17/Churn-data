# Churn-data Analysis
The dataset includes information on bank customers such as their demographics, credit scores, account balances, etc. The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) or not based on the available information.
The script imports the required libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. It then reads the CSV file using the pandas read_csv method and stores it in a pandas DataFrame. The script then performs exploratory data analysis by displaying the head and tail of the dataset, checking for null values using the isnull method, and generating descriptive statistics using the describe method.
After the initial data exploration, the script splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method from scikit-learn. It then trains a logistic regression model on the training set using the OneVsRestClassifier method from scikit-learn. The script then evaluates the model's performance on the test set by computing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score using scikit-learn's metrics module. Additionally, it plots the ROC curve and computes the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's performance.
